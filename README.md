### What are you doing here?

In the unlikely event you've found yourself here on purpose, here's a bit about me, in no particular order.

* I am a nerd, for good and ill.
* I am ADHD, also for good and ill.
* I like video games, both playing and working on them.
  * I helped two different game companies launch products. Once in an advisory position, the other as an actual dev handling macOS and Linux development.
    * Somehow, on the latter, I managed to pull a functioning graphics engine out of my brain while knowing precious little about it.
* I'm playing with a certain launcher out of self-interest.
  * Hoyo, if you're reading this, call us. We want to help the Deck players if we can, and if you'll have us.
* This is my personal profile, not my corp. Whatever is here, is not endorsed by anyone.
